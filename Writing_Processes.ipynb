    "### Additional Features referenced in the Kaggle Desc\n",
    "1. Production Rate\n",
    "        - The rate of written language production can be measured by counting the number of characters, words, clauses, sentences, or T-units in the writing process or written product generated per unit of time. Example measures are as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "        a. number of characters (including spaces) produced per minute during the process\n",
    "        b. number of characters (including spaces) produced per minute in the product\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pause\n",
    "        - Pause: Pauses are generally defined as inter-keystroke intervals (IKI) above a certain threshold (e.g., 2000 milliseconds). The IKI refers to the gap time between two consecutive key presses typically expressed in milliseconds. To illustrate, suppose a writer types a character \"A\" at time 1 and then a character \"B\" at time 2. One can obtain the IKI between the two characters simply using the formula: IKI = Time2 - Time1. Global measures of pausing are usually associated with the duration and frequency of pauses calculated from different dimensions. Below are some typical pause measures.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        a. number of pauses (in total or per minute) \n",
    "        b. proportion of pause time (as a % of total writing time)\n",
    "        c. pause length (usually the mean duration of all pauses in text production)\n",
    "        d. pause lengths or frequencies within words, between words, between sentences, between paragraphs, etc.\n",
    "        \n",
    "3. Revision: Revisions are operations of deletions or insertions in writing. A deletion is defined as the removal of any stretch of characters from a text whereas an insertion refers to a sequence of activities to add characters to a growing text (except the end). Below are some commonly used revision measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "        a. number of deletions (in total or per minute)\n",
    "        b. number of insertions (in total or per minute)\n",
    "        c. length of deletions (in characters)\n",
    "        d. length of insertions (in characters)\n",
    "        e. proportion of deletions (as a % of total writing time)\n",
    "        f. proportion of insertions (as a % of total writing time)\n",
    "        g. product vs. process ratio (The number of characters in the product divided by the number of characters produced during the writing process)\n",
    "        h. number/length of revisions at the point of inscription (i.e., at the current end of a text being produced)\n",
    "        i. number/length of revisions after the text has been transcribed (i.e., at a previous point in the text)\n",
    "        j. number of immediate revisions (the distance between the position of the flashing cursor and the revision point equal to zero)\n",
    "        k. number of distant revisions (the distance between the position of the flashing cursor and the revision point larger than zero)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "4. Process Variance: Process variance attends to the dynamics of the writing process in relation to time and thus represents how the writer's fluency may differ at different stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Process variance is generally measured by first dividing the whole writing process into a certain number of equal time intervals (e.g., 5 or 10) and then calculating the total number of characters produced in the intervals (often normalized to the average number of characters per minute), or to make it more comparable among writers, the proportion of characters produced per interval. \n",
    "        \n",
    "        The standard deviation of characters produced per interval is also calculated from keystroke logs as an indicator of process variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there may be events in the test set that do not occur in the training set. Your solution should be robust to unseen events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Key_down and key_up events may not necessarily occur in the same order as they are presented in the dataset. To illustrate, a writer may press down \"a\" and then press down \"b\" before he/she even releases \"a\". However, all the keystroke information about \"a\" comes before \"b\" in the dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "`test_logs.csv` - Input logs to be used as test data. Contains the same fields as train_logs.csv. The logs available in the public version of this file are only examples to illustrate the format.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`train_scores.csv`\n",
    "id - The unique ID of the essay\n",
    "score - The score the essay received out of 6 (the prediction target for the competition)\n",
    "sample_submission.csv - A submission file in the correct format. See the Evaluation page for details."

    "### Distribution Visualizations\n",
    "##### Four different methods of displaying the distribution of scores in our data set. I would describe this data as adhering to a normal distribution. Of all the options, I think that the histplot with 12 bins corresponding to the 12 different discrete score values registers the strongest in terms of representing a distribution whereas the bar plot and count plot each have a bit more visual appeal, but their gaps between bars weakens the immediate visual recognition of the plot representing score distributions.

    "2. Pause\n",
    "        - Pause: Pauses are generally defined as inter-keystroke intervals (IKI) above a certain threshold (e.g., 2000 milliseconds). The IKI refers to the gap time between two consecutive key presses typically expressed in milliseconds. To illustrate, suppose a writer types a character \"A\" at time 1 and then a character \"B\" at time 2. One can obtain the IKI between the two characters simply using the formula: IKI = Time2 - Time1. Global measures of pausing are usually associated with the duration and frequency of pauses calculated from different dimensions. Below are some typical pause measures.\n",

    "        a. number of pauses (in total or per minute) \n",

    "        \n",
    "3. Revision: Revisions are operations of deletions or insertions in writing. A deletion is defined as the removal of any stretch of characters from a text whereas an insertion refers to a sequence of activities to add characters to a growing text (except the end). Below are some commonly used revision measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "        a. number of deletions (in total or per minute)\n",
    "        b. number of insertions (in total or per minute)\n",
    "        c. length of deletions (in characters)\n",
    "        d. length of insertions (in characters)\n",
    "        e. proportion of deletions (as a % of total writing time)\n",
    "        f. proportion of insertions (as a % of total writing time)\n",
    "        g. product vs. process ratio (The number of characters in the product divided by the number of characters produced during the writing process)\n",
    "        h. number/length of revisions at the point of inscription (i.e., at the current end of a text being produced)\n",
    "        i. number/length of revisions after the text has been transcribed (i.e., at a previous point in the text)\n",
    "        j. number of immediate revisions (the distance between the position of the flashing cursor and the revision point equal to zero)\n",
    "        k. number of distant revisions (the distance between the position of the flashing cursor and the revision point larger than zero)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "4. Process Variance: Process variance attends to the dynamics of the writing process in relation to time and thus represents how the writer's fluency may differ at different stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Process variance is generally measured by first dividing the whole writing process into a certain number of equal time intervals (e.g., 5 or 10) and then calculating the total number of characters produced in the intervals (often normalized to the average number of characters per minute), or to make it more comparable among writers, the proportion of characters produced per interval. \n",
    "        \n",
    "        The standard deviation of characters produced per interval is also calculated from keystroke logs as an indicator of process variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there may be events in the test set that do not occur in the training set. Your solution should be robust to unseen events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Key_down and key_up events may not necessarily occur in the same order as they are presented in the dataset. To illustrate, a writer may press down \"a\" and then press down \"b\" before he/she even releases \"a\". However, all the keystroke information about \"a\" comes before \"b\" in the dataframe.\n",
